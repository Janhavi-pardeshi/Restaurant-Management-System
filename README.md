## Introduction

This thesis explores various aspects of abstraction encountered during the design and implementation of the web programming language Links. A key focus is on user interfaces specified using HTML forms. The goal is to construct forms from existing form fragments without introducing dependencies on the implementation details of those fragments. Surprisingly, many existing web systems do not support this seemingly straightforward scenario. To address this, we present a library that captures the essence of form abstraction and extend it with practical features such as validation of the HTML produced by a program and the input submitted by users.

##  Objectives
